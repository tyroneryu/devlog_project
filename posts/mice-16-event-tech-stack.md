# The Digital Backbone of Events

As a MICE planner, your "Tech Stack" is just as important as your venue selection. Relying on Excel for a 2,000-person event is a recipe for data fragmentation and human error.

## 1. The Core: EMS (Event Management Software)

Platforms like **Cvent**, **EventsAir**, or **Bizzabo** act as your Single Source of Truth.
*   **Registration**: Real-time tracking of ticket sales and dietary requirements.
*   **Budgeting**: Automated tracking of vendor payments and tax reconciliation.

## 2. Spatial Planning: Floorplan Automation

**AllSeated** or **Social Tables** allow for 3D collaborative floor planning.
*   *Why*: You can share a live link with the venue and the decorator. If you move a table in the software, the electrical plan and the catering count update automatically.

## 3. Attendee Engagement & Networking

The "Event App" is the remote control for the attendee experience.
*   **Socio (Webex Events)** or **Swapcard**: These platforms use AI to suggest networking partners based on profile keywords, significantly increasing the "Serendipity Score" of the event.

## 4. Onsite Ops: Communication

Stop using WhatsApp for mission-critical onsite ops. Use **Zello** (push-to-talk over IP) or **Slack** with dedicated channels for #AV-Issues, #VIP-Movement, and #Catering-Alerts.

## Conclusion

A modern planner is a "Technological Orchestrator." By integrating these tools via APIs, you free yourself from manual data entry and gain the headspace to focus on what really matters: high-touch hospitality and creative execution.
