# Analysis Report on Digital and AI Transformation (DX/AX) Status and Future Advancement Strategies in the Korean MICE Market

## The Paradigm Shift of the Korean MICE Industry and the Macro Environment of 2025

The South Korean MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) industry has moved beyond a mere recovery from the global health crisis to a stage of qualitative growth driven by technology.[1, 2, 3] The years 2024 and 2025 mark a turning point where the industry achieved full quantitative recovery to pre-pandemic levels while fundamentally reforming its structure through Digital Transformation (DX) and AI Transformation (AX).[4, 5] In particular, the successful preparation for the 2025 APEC Summit in Gyeongju serves as a decisive moment to establish global trust in "K-MICE," showcasing a combination of hardware infrastructure and software technical capabilities.[5, 3]

Currently, the domestic MICE market faces complex challenges: rising operating costs due to inflation, a severe labor shortage, and a digital divide between companies.[4, 5, 6, 7] These environmental pressures have forced Professional Congress Organizers (PCOs) and Professional Exhibition Organizers (PEOs) to shift from traditional labor-intensive operations to technology-intensive structures utilizing AI and data, viewing it as a matter of survival.[4, 6, 8, 7] According to the 2025 global outlook, 74% of professionals are optimistic about the future, although the importance of adopting technology to maximize performance within limited budgets is emphasized more than ever.[6]

## Stages of Digital Transformation (DX) in the Domestic MICE Market: Statistical Analysis

According to the results of the 2024 Digital Industry Status Survey (based on 2023 data), Korea's digital industry revenue reached approximately 1,261 trillion KRW, accounting for 14.5% of the total industry.[9, 10] The service and platform-utilizing industries, to which MICE belongs, are following this trend, but distinct differences are observed in the specific stages of transformation.

| Industry Category | Computerization Stage (%) | Digitalization Stage (%) | Digital Transformation Stage (%) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Digital-based Industry | 29.2 | 43.6 | 3.9 |
| Digital Platform Providing Industry | 3.0 | 18.0 | 20.8 |
| Digital Platform Utilizing Industry (incl. MICE) | 36.1 | 42.4 | 1.4 |
| Total Digital Industry Average | 35.5 | 41.0 | 2.1 |

As shown in the table, in the case of digital platform-utilizing industries closely related to MICE, more than 78% of companies have reached the stages of computerization and early digitalization.[9] However, only 1.4% have reached the "Digital Transformation Stage," where the business model itself is completely reorganized digitally.[9] Barriers to DX include a lack of infrastructure, insufficient high-performance computing environments, and difficulties in securing high-quality industrial data.[8, 11, 7]

## Implementation Status of PCOs and PEOs: Smart MICE and Infrastructure Advancement

Major hub cities in Korea are expanding MICE infrastructure while simultaneously working to "smarten" these facilities.[1] Projects like the KINTEX third exhibition hall, the remodeling of COEX, and the expansion of BEXCO aim to evolve into platforms where advanced DX technologies—such as indoor wayfinding, AI kiosks, and data-based movement analysis—are integrated [[1], S_R57, S_R79].

### On-site Application of Smart MICE Operation Technology

PCOs and PEOs are actively adopting robot and AI technologies to reduce labor costs and improve operational accuracy.[1, 11] Floor marking robots for exhibition halls have automated booth layout tasks, significantly saving time and manpower.[1, 11] AI moderators and guide robots improve visitor convenience while serving as channels for data collection.[1, 11] Furthermore, systems that analyze real-time visitor behavior data to determine optimal staff placement or respond to unexpected situations are leading the "scientification" of MICE operations.

### Transformation into Platform-Centric Business Models

The emergence of "all-in-one platforms" like EZPMP's "O2MEET" is solving system fragmentation by providing modularized functions ranging from website creation to business matching.[12, 13, 14, 15] These platforms are built in a Microservices Architecture (MSA) environment, ensuring business continuity through cloud-based real-time data synchronization.[12, 13, 14]

## The Core of AI Transformation (AX): Generative AI and Task Automation

The year 2025 is defined as the era of AX, where AI takes the lead in tasks beyond simple DX.[15, 7] Generative AI has fundamentally changed core work processes such as proposal writing, data analysis, and marketing content generation.

### Drastic Efficiency in Proposal Writing and Administrative Work

The field where domestic PCOs experience the greatest utility is the stage of writing proposals for government contracts.[16] According to the case of "MICE All-in-One," an AI-based proposal writing platform, the time for writing proposals in the "Narajangteo" format was reduced by 70%, leading to a three-fold increase in annual submissions.[16] AI tools extract core requirements through smart RFP analysis and present optimal strategic drafts combined with past data.[12, 16, 17, 18]

| AI Application Field | Key Performance Indicators | Main Functions and Tools |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Proposal Planning | 70% reduction in work time | Smart RFP analysis, custom template generation [16] |
| Academic/Association Mgmt | 60% reduction in operating costs | Participant mgmt systems without IT experts [16] |
| Business Matching | 45% increase in matching rate | AI-based interest analysis and auto-scheduling [12, 13] |
| Event Website Construction | Built in 2 weeks | Builders with auto-reflected center info [16] |

### Personalized Experience Design and Data Insights

Attendees now demand customized experiences designed specifically for them.[6, 19] AI makes "large-scale personalized services" possible by analyzing vast participant data to recommend sessions that match individual interests or precisely match partners with high business potential.[6, 19, 13, 20] This plays a pivotal role in maximizing the "Return on Relationships (ROR)" beyond simple information provision.[6, 20]

## Strengthening Global Competitiveness: Korea and Singapore Comparison

South Korea ranks world-class in its global AI infrastructure index with a score of 7.17, following Singapore (8.91).[21] While Korea recorded an overwhelming score of 9.91 in the government technology maturity index, Singapore's National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0) and Digital Leaders Programme (DLP) offer a more sophisticated roadmap for private sector adoption and the establishment of AI Centres of Excellence (COEs). Singapore excels in business-friendly environments and the distribution of industry-specific playbooks to lower the threshold for technology adoption.

## Future Strategic Recommendations: How Should We Move Forward?

To lead the MICE market after 2025, domestic PCOs and PEOs need a change in identity to "Business Designers".[4, 6, 3]

1.  **Data-Centric Decision Systems**: Every event must start with data collection and end with data analysis. A virtuous cycle must be created by accumulating interaction data for future planning.
2.  **Advanced AI Collaboration**: AI utilization must enter the stage of being a partner in strategy establishment, using generative AI for real-time simulation of hosting suitability and potential participant preferences.
3.  **Hyper-Personalization**: Intelligent campaigns should be deployed where AI composes marketing messages and determines the timing of transmission based on each participant's interest history.[6, 19, 20, 22]
4.  **Sustainability (ESG) and Technology**: Technology for measuring and reducing the carbon footprint is becoming an "entry ticket" to the global market. The adoption of digital tools for paperless events and energy saving should be accelerated.[1, 20, 22]

## Conclusion: The Completion of K-MICE AX

The digital and AI transformation of the South Korean MICE industry is no longer a story of the distant future but a scene of survival.[8, 7, 23] PCOs and PEOs should use technology as a strategic tool to focus on areas where human creativity is needed.[5, 15] With government support through voucher programs and specialized personnel training, K-MICE can establish itself as the most innovative model in the global business events market.
