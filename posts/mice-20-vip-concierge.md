# The Logistics of Luxury

When hosting a Fortune 500 CEO or a Global Head of State, "Standard Service" is a failure. You need a dedicated **VIP Concierge Layer** that operates independently of the main event logistics.

## 1. The Tarmac Hand-off

For ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) guests, the experience begins at the airplane door.
*   **Greeters**: Use a VIP meet-and-greet service that handles immigration in a private lounge while the guest's luggage is fetched.
*   **Transport**: The vehicle should be "Event Ready"—bottled water of their preferred brand, Wi-Fi passwords printed, and a tablet with the latest event agenda.

## 2. The Personalized Dossier

Don't send a generic PDF. Provide a physical or digital "VIP Dossier":
*   **Bio of their Moderator**: Who will be interviewing them?
*   **Brief on the Audience**: Who is in the first row?
*   **Personal Touches**: "We have reserved your favorite table at [Restaurant] for tonight."

## 3. Room Blocks and the 'Ghost Floor'

For security and privacy, place VIPs in a "Hotel within a Hotel" (e.g., Club Floors).
*   **The Ghost Floor**: Ensure the room next to the VIP is occupied by their security or a trusted staff member to minimize noise and traffic.

## 4. The Exit Protocol

The job isn't done until they are back in the air. 
*   **Pre-check**: Staff should pre-check the VIP for their flight and coordinate with the driver to ensure they arrive exactly 90 minutes before take-off (no more, no less).

## Conclusion

VIP management is about **anticipation**. If the guest has to ask for something, you have already failed. By obsessing over the micro-details of their schedule, you allow them to perform at their best on your stage.
