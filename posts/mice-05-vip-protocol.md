# The Art of Handling VIPs

In the MICE industry, a "VIP" isn't just a rich attendee. It refers to individuals whose presence requires specific operational alterations: Heads of State, Government Ministers, Royalty, or Fortune 500 CEOs.

Handling these guests requires a specialized skill set known as **Protocol**. It is a mix of diplomacy, security logistics, and high-end hospitality.

## 1. The Advance Team (The Recce)

High-level VIPs never arrive unscheduled. Their "Advance Team" (Security detail + Personal Assistants) will visit the venue weeks prior.
*   **Route Mapping**: They will map the exact path from the car drop-off to the Green Room to the Stage.
*   **Egress Routes**: "If something happens, what is the fastest way out?"
*   **Action**: As a planner, build a relationship with the Head of Security. They can shut down your event if they feel unsafe. Cooperate fully.

## 2. Seating Hierarchy

Seating is political. Getting it wrong can cause diplomatic incidents.
*   **The Right-Hand Rule**: In international protocol, the place of honor is to the **right** of the host.
    *   Host (Center) -> Guest of Honor (Right) -> #2 Guest (Left) -> #3 Guest (Right of Guest of Honor).
*   **Front Row Management**: Never leave empty seats in the front row. If a VIP cancels last minute, you must have "seat fillers" (usually staff or lower-tier VIPs) ready to move up.

## 3. The Green Room (Holding Area)

The Green Room is the sanctuary. It must be:
*   **Private**: No random staff asking for selfies. Access control must be strict.
*   **Equipped**: High-speed Wi-Fi, mirrors, iron/steamer, and specific dietary catering.
*   **Buffered**: The VIP should arrive here 30 minutes before stage time to decompress and be mic'd up by audio technicians in private, not in the hallway.

## 4. Stage Protocol and Flags

If government officials are speaking, flag protocol is mandatory.
*   **Positioning**: The host country's flag takes the position of honor (stage right, or viewer's left).
*   **Condition**: Flags must be ironed / steamed. A wrinkled national flag is a sign of disrespect.

## 5. The "Hand-Off"

The most dangerous moment is the transition.
*   Car to Door.
*   Green Room to Stage.
*   Stage to Exit.

You need "Pointers"—staff members positioned at every corner to silently point the way. VIPs are often blinded by lights or distracted by nerves; they should never have to guess where to walk.

## Conclusion

Protocol is about **respect** and **predictability**. By removing friction and adhering to established rules of hierarchy, you allow the VIPs to focus on their message, and you ensure the event reflects positively on the host organization's reputation.
