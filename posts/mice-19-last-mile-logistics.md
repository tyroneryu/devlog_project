# Crossing Borders without Fines

If you are shipping a prototype robot from Seoul to a trade show in Germany, you are not "exporting" it; you are "temporarily importing" it. If you get the paperwork wrong, customs can seize your gear or charge you 20% VAT at the border.

## 1. The ATA Carnet (The Passport for Goods)

The **ATA Carnet** is an international customs document that allows the duty-free and tax-free temporary import of goods for up to one year.
*   *Application*: Requires a detailed list (General List) of every item, serial number, weight, and value.
*   *Validation*: You must get the Carnet stamped by customs upon *every* exit and entry. Miss one stamp, and you face heavy penalties.

## 2. Marshaling and drayage

Convention centers are logistical bottlenecks.
*   **Marshaling Yard**: A remote parking lot where trucks wait for their "Time Slot." Never tell a vendor to drive directly to the loading dock.
*   **Drayage**: The service of moving freight from the loading dock to the booth. This is often a union-regulated monopoly in major US cities. Check the "Price per CWT" (100 lbs) in your exhibitor manual.

## 3. The 'Dead Man's Box'

Always ship a "Job Box" with essential tools (gaffer tape, zip ties, multi-tools, power converters, HDMI cables). The venue will charge you 10x the retail price for a single roll of tape.

## Conclusion

Logistics is the least "glamorous" part of MICE, but it's the foundation of the show. A missing crate can ruin a $1M product launch. Partner with a dedicated **Event Freight Forwarder** who understands the "Date-Critical" nature of our industry.
