# Data is the New Swag

Sponsors don't just want logos on banners; they want leads.

Using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons, we can track:
*   **Dwell Time**: How long did people stand in front of Booth A vs Booth B?
*   **Session Flow**: Did people leave the keynote early? At what minute mark?

This data allows us to optimize floor plans for the next year and justify sponsorship pricing tiers.
