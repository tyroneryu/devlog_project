# The Modern Menu

Dietary restrictions are the norm, not the exception. Standard catering now requires:

*   **Labeling**: Every item must have allergens clearly marked (GF, DF, V, VG, NF).
*   **Station Style**: Buffets allow people to customize their plates, reducing waste compared to plated meals where people leave what they can't eat.
*   **Brain Food**: Heavy carbs (pasta) induce "food comas" in the afternoon sessions. Switch to proteins and complex carbs to keep energy levels high.
