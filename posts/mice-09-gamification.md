# Make it a Game

Passive attendees are bored attendees. We implemented a "Passport Challenge" in the event app.

*   **Mechanic**: Scan QR codes at exhibitor booths to earn points.
*   **Reward**: Top 10 on the leaderboard win prizes at the closing ceremony.

**Result**: Exhibitor lead scans increased by 150%. Gamification aligns attendee incentives (fun/prizes) with organizer goals (booth traffic).
