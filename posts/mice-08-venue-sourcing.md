# Function Over Form

A historic castle looks great on Instagram, but if it has one service elevator and no loading dock, your load-in will take 3 days instead of 1.

## Site Inspection Checklist
1.  **Ceiling Height**: Is it high enough for your screen/stage set?
2.  **Pillars**: Are there sightline obstructions?
3.  **Power Access**: Are floor boxes available, or do we need to tape cables everywhere?
4.  **Wi-Fi Infrastructure**: Can it handle 1,000 simultaneous connections?
