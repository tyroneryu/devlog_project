# Expect the Unexpected

In live events, there is no "Compile and Test." There is only production. When things go wrong, they go wrong publicly, in front of thousands of people. Murphy's Law applies doubly in the MICE industry.

Effective crisis management isn't about preventing every disaster—that's impossible. It's about having pre-planned responses to mitigate them instantly.

## The "Red Folder" Protocol

Every senior staff member (Event Manager, Stage Manager, Security Lead) must carry a physical or offline-accessible "Red Folder". This contains:
1.  **Chain of Command**: Who makes the call to evacuate? (Usually not the CEO, but the Safety Officer).
2.  **Emergency Scripts**: Pre-written announcements for the MC. You don't want an MC ad-libbing during a fire alarm.
    *   *Script A (Minor Delay)*: "Ladies and gentlemen, we are pausing for a brief technical adjustment..."
    *   *Script B (Evacuation)*: "Attention please. We have been asked to clear the hall. Please calmly exit via..."
3.  **Vendor Emergency Contacts**: Not the sales rep, but the 24/7 technical support numbers for AV, Venue, and Transport.

## Scenario 1: The Keynote Speaker is Missing

It happens. Flight delays, traffic, or illness.
*   **The Buffer**: Never schedule the VIP keynote as the very first item without a buffer. Have a welcome video or a generic host intro to buy time.
*   **The "Pocket Session"**: Have a backup speaker or a panel discussion ready to go. Often, you can extend the break or ask the MC to facilitate a networking activity ("Turn to your neighbor and discuss...").

## Scenario 2: Wi-Fi Collapse

For a tech conference, this is a disaster.
*   **Hardline Everything**: Registration desks and speaker podiums must be hardwired (Ethernet). Never rely on Wi-Fi for mission-critical operations.
*   **Offline Mode**: Ensure your check-in scanners can work offline and sync later.
*   **Communication**: Be honest. "We are experiencing ISP issues." Don't blame the users ("Turn off your hotspots").

## Scenario 3: Medical Emergency

If an attendee collapses in the hall:
*   **Do Not Call 911/119 Directly**: Call the Venue Security Control Room (Command Center). They know exactly which door the ambulance should come to and will escort paramedics. Calling public emergency services directly can delay response as they struggle to navigate the massive convention center complex.
*   **Crowd Control**: Staff must form a privacy wall (human shield) around the patient to prevent bystanders from filming.

## Conclusion

Crisis management is 90% preparation and 10% execution. By tabletop-testing these scenarios ("What if the power fails right now?") during your pre-con meetings, you build the muscle memory required to act calmly when the heat is on. In the end, the audience will judge you not by the mistake, but by how professionally you handled it.
