# The Contract is the Product

In event planning, your ability to negotiate a contract is more valuable than your ability to choose a floral centerpiece. A bad contract exposes your organization to tens of thousands of dollars in liability.

The two most dangerous clauses are **Attrition** and **Force Majeure**.

## 1. Attrition: The "Empty Room" Penalty

When you block 500 rooms for a conference, the hotel takes them off the market. If you only use 300, the hotel loses money. Attrition is the clause that forces you to pay for the unused rooms.

**Standard Hotel Offer:**
*   "Client agrees to pay for 90% of the room block."
*   "Calculation is per night."

**The Planner's Counter-Strategy:**
1.  **Lower the Bar**: Negotiate attrition down to 80% or 75%.
2.  **Cumulative Pickup**: Never accept "Per Night" calculation.
    *   *Scenario*: You block 100 rooms for Day 1 and 100 for Day 2.
    *   *Reality*: 50 people stay Day 1, 150 people stay Day 2. Total = 200 rooms sold.
    *   *Per Night Rule*: You pay a penalty for Day 1.
    *   *Cumulative Rule*: You sold 200/200 total room nights. **No Penalty.**
3.  **Resell Clause**: Ensure the contract states: "Client will not be charged for attrition rooms that are successfully resold to other guests." You shouldn't pay if the hotel is 100% full anyway.

## 2. Force Majeure: Acts of God (and Government)

Pre-2020, this was a boilerplate clause about hurricanes and earthquakes. Post-COVID, it is the most scrutinized paragraph.

"Impossibility" is too high a bar. You need to negotiate for **"Inadvisability"** or **"Commercial Impracticability."**

*   **Explicit Inclusions**: The clause must list "Pandemic," "Epidemic," "Government restriction on travel," "CDC Travel Advisory," and "Curtailment of transportation."
*   **Timeline**: Ensure the clause can be invoked up to 7 days prior to arrival, not just "at the time of the event."

## 3. The "No Walk" Clause

Hotels oversell. It's a fact of the industry. If your VIP Keynote Speaker arrives at midnight and the hotel is full, they might "walk" them to a sister property 20 minutes away.

**The Strategy**:
Include a specific "No Walk" clause for your VIP list and Staff.
*   "If the Hotel must walk a guest, Hotel agrees to:
    1.  Pay for the night at the alternative hotel.
    2.  Provide round-trip transportation.
    3.  Credit the room night to the group's pickup.
    4.  Move the guest back to the primary Hotel the next morning."

## Conclusion

Negotiation is leverage. The best time to negotiate is **before** you sign the LOI (Letter of Intent). Once the hotel knows they are your only choice, your leverage vanishes. Always source 3 venues, and let them know they are competing.
