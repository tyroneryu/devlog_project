# Where the Budget Bleeds

Venue rental is just the tip of the iceberg. 

## Drayage (Material Handling)
Union fees for moving boxes from the dock to the booth can be astronomical. Consolidate shipments to minimize weight tickets.

## Rigging & Power
Venues charge for "points" in the ceiling to hang lights, and separate fees for the motors, and separate fees for the power to run the motors. Always read the exhibitor manual's fine print.
